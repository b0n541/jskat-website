			<h1>Welcome!</h1>
			
			<p>
			You want to play a round of Skat but your buddies don't have time?<br/>
			You want to improve your playing skills without losing money?<br/>
			You want to learn how to play Ramsch smarter than the others?
			</p>

			<p>Then JSkat is the right choice for you!</p>

			<p>
			JSkat is a free implementation of the German card game Skat in 
			Java<sup>TM</sup>. You can play it on nearly every platform that 
			runs a modern Java Runtime Environment. Until now we only know that
			it runs on Windows and Linux with the JRE from Sun, but we like to 
			hear from you, if it's playable on other platforms, too.
			</p>

			<h2>Who is behind it</h2>

			<p>
			JSkat is written by Jan&nbsp;Sch&auml;fer and Markus&nbsp;J.&nbsp;Luzius.
			It's a non profit project that steals a lot of our spare time. ;o)
			Our goal is to develop a free computer Skat game that can play 
			either according to the official rules or with a customized special 
			ruleset that is often played in the pubs.
			</p>

			<h2>Current affairs</h2> 
 
			<p> 
			2011/03/26: JSkat is approaching the beta phase for version 0.7 in
			the near future. This version is a complete rewrite of JSkat with
			new AI players and features. You will be able to play over the 
			internet on the International Skat Server against human players or
			the strongest AI players known today.
			</p>
			
			<p> 
			2009/05/23: You are probably wondering if JSkat is still a living project, since the last version 
			was released in August 2007. But be assured: We are still working on JSkat!<br/> 
			Unfortunately, we did not have as much time as we would have liked, so JSkat went on
			something similar to a hiatus, but behind the scenes, Jan has done a major refactoring
			and implemented a whole new AI player. Due to the refactoring, the AI players from previous
			versions do not work any longer and need some recoding. This is the reason why there isn't a 
			new release out already.<br/> 
			However, we would appreciate it if you download the release 0.6 to show your interest. 
			And feedback is always welcome...
